#2.1 Why Object?

##2.1.1 Real World Problem
Given this list of students, find the student id that has the highest score. (If more than one, list all of them.) The first line of input is the number of students, followed by lines of student and the score.

Without having the knowledge of object oriented programming, you will do this :
```Java
public static void main (String [] args) throws Exception {
	BufferedReader br=new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
	int n=Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());
	String [] name=new String[n];
	int [] score=new int [n];
	for (int i=0;i<n;i++) {
		StringTokenizer st=new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());
		name[i]=st.nextToken();
		score[i]=Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());
	}
	int maxScore=score[0];
	for (int i=1;i<n;i++) if (score[i]>maxScore) maxScore=score[i]; //We get the highest score.
	
	for (int i=1;i<n;i++) if (score[i]==maxScore) System.out.println(name[i]);
	//Search for row that has the highest score and print.
}
```

##2.1.2 The Analogy
Did you notice that we use the index of the score to refer to the name? This is the idea of object. Object wraps the data for us by providing an ID that is generated implicitly by Java VM. Previously we used array to store the data and the array index as our ID. Now let's see how we use Object to achieve the same thing. 

First, right click on your package, then New... > Class. Put **Student** in the name field, then press **Finish**. Eclipse will open up Student.java for you with the following content :
```Java
package myproject; //depending on your package name.
public class Student {
}
```
Next, add a name variable and a score variable into the class. It should look like this :
```Java
package myproject; //depending on your package name.
public class Student {
	public String name;
	public int score;
}
```
The name and score is identical to the array, but with object, the way of access is different. We also need to instantiate the ID. The variable here is also called as instance variable (as it differs from instance of object/ID to another) or attribute.

## 2.1.3 The Improved Version
Go back to our main class previously. This is the example on how to use Object.
```Java
public static void main (String [] args) throws Exception {
	BufferedReader br=new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
	int n=Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());
	Student [] std=new Student[n]; //Create an Student object array
	for (int i=0;i<n;i++) {
		StringTokenizer st=new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());
		Student s=new Student(); //Instantiate an Student object.
		std[i]=s; //Put the object into array.
		s.name=st.nextToken(); //Set the student.name to input name.
		s.score=Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken()); //Do the same on score
	}
	int maxScore=std[0].score
	for (int i=1;i<n;i++) if (std[i].score>maxScore) maxScore=std[i].score; //We get the highest score.
	
	for (int i=1;i<n;i++) if (std[i].score==maxScore) System.out.println(std[i].name);
	//Search for row that has the highest score and print.
}
```
The advantage of using object is that the attributes always follow the object. When dealing with swapping of values in an array, we always need to make sure all of the related array also perform the same swap. But with object, single swap of object can achieve the same thing with less code! 

Don't believe? Refer to the input data, swap position of Emma with Brutus.
