#1.4 Variable

##1.4.1 Data Pointer
We have created some values and printed them out earlier. Now, we are going to learn how to have them hold in the memory. Variable is the pointer that refers to the memory location of the data. By using variable, we can store the data as long as we want. 

Here is how we declare and use it :
```Java
public static void main (String [] args) {
	int two = 2;
	int three = 3;
	System.out.println( two + three );
}
```
Your computer will retrieve the value of "two" and "three", sum them, and print the result in the console. 

Or if you decided to be naughty, you can do this to confuse others :
```Java
public static void main (String [] args) {
	int five = 1;
	int eight = 3;
	System.out.println( five + eight );
}
```
The console will output 4. The compiler doesn't care your variable naming, but the values inside.

## 1.4.2 Variable Naming Standard
There are some limitations when naming your variable:

* The first character must be alphabet.
* The name must only contain alphabets, numbers and underscore.

It is also good to know :

* Use camelCase in the variable declared within method.
* The name should make sense, not like int a, int b. You will confuse yourself later on.
* The name must be unique within it's scope.

## 1.4.3 More Variable Usage
String Concatenation
```Java
public static void main (String [] args) {
	String sentence = “My name is ”;
	String name = “John.”;
	System.out.println( sentence + name );
}
```
We can reuse variable as long as we want :
```Java
public static void main (String [] args) {
	String testString = “I’m the first String!”; //declaration + assigning value
	System.out.println( testString );
	testString = “I’m the second String!”; // assigning value
	System.out.println( testString );
}
```

##Exercise
Modify the value of yearsOld in the code below to make it display "I'm 100 years old now."
```Java
public static void main (String [] args) {
	String sentencePart1;
	String yearsOld;
	String sentencePart2;
	sentencePart1 = “I’m ” ;
	sentencePart2 = “ years old now.” ;
	System.out.println( sentencePart1+yearsOld+sentencePart2 );
}
```
Modify the answer above so that it fits into single line.
