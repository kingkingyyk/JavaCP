#1.5 Going Interactive

##1.5.1. Scanner
Without user interaction, the program is boring. In this section, I will be introducing the Scanner class. It allows the user to input value. 
```Java
package HelloWorld;

import java.util.Scanner; //We need to import this library to enable the function.

public class HelloWorld {
	
	public static void main (String [] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in); //feeds the system input into scanner.
		System.out.print("Please input anything : "); /* println adds a new line, while print doesn't.
							      you can experiment by changing it to println
							      and see what happens.*/
		String input = sc.nextLine(); /* wait for the user to input anything and press enter.
					    The user input will be saved into the variable input. */
		System.out.println("You just entered this : " + input); // display the value stored in input
	}
}
```Java
Sometimes if we need to convert the String to int or double to perform mathematical operation, we need to use Integer.parseInt( value ) or Double.parseDouble( value ) to convert, where the value should be a String value or String variable.

```Java
//Case1
int a=Integer.parseInt("1") //convert 1 into int and assign to a

//Case 2
String lol="123.5"
double b=Double.parseDouble(lol) //convert lol into int and assign to b
```
		
Exercise : Or if you decided to be naughty, you can do this to confuse others :
```Java
public static void main (String [] args) {
	int five = 1;
	int eight = 3;
	System.out.println( five + eight );
}
```

##Exercise
Write a program that accepts 2 numbers from the user and displays the sum of the entered numbers. It should look like this :
```Java
Please enter the first number : 56
Please enter the second number : 89
The answer is 145.
```

Write a program that accepts 3 numbers from the user and displays the answer after performing the calculation : x + y % z. It should look like this :
```Java
Please enter value of x : 123
Please enter value for y : 5869
Please enter value for z : 12
The answer is 124.
```
