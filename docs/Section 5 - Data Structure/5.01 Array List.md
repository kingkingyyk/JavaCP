#5.1 Array List
Have you ever encountered the issue of running out of slot (or index >= array size) in array? ArrayList is aimed to solve this. First, we will create our own ArrayList. Java has a built-in ArrayList as well.

The main issue here is handling the situation when index >= array size issue. How about running out of slot? It will cause the same issue.

One of the way to solve this is to create a new array that holds the objects in the same slot with the old array, but with larger size.

```Java
public class ArrayList<T> {
	private static int DEFAULT_SIZE=10;
	private T [] obj;
	
	public ArrayList () {
		this.obj=(T []) new Object[ArrayList.DEFAULT_SIZE];
	}
	public ArrayList (int size) {
		this.obj=(T[]) new Object[size];
	}
	
	public void set (int index, T t) {
		if (index>=obj.length) {
			//we need to create a bigger array...
			T [] newAry=(T []) new Object[index+1];
//copy data from old array to new array...
			System.arraycopy(this.obj, 0, newAry, 0, this.obj.length);
			this.obj=newAry;
		}
		//Store the value!
		this.obj[index]=t;
	}
	
	public T get (int index) {
		if (index<obj.length) {
			return obj[index];
		}
		return null;
	}
	
	public int size () {
		return this.obj.length;
	}
}
```
Java has it’s built-in ArrayList. The documentation (includes methods & usages) can be gotten <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html" target="_blank">here</a>

However, due to method calling, this is slower than using the array natively. The primitive types need to be used in Object type (i.e `int` in `Integer`), which also causes slow down.
