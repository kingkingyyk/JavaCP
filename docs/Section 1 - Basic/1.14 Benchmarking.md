##1.14.1 The Execution Time

It is important to know the time for the computer to execute your code. If you code is slow, it would exceed time limit (inefficient)! (Ever faced it in USACO?). 

It is also fun to compete this with others other than having correct answer. The simple way to measure execution time is to use timestamp.

```Java
long timestampBefore = System.currentTimeMillis();
//run your code here.
long timestampAfter = System.currentTimeMillis();
long timeTaken = timestampAfter-timestampBefore;
System.out.println("Took "+timeTaken+"ms to run.");
```

In order to measure the accurate value, use the same computer to run the codes. Run it for 5 times and get the median. Remember to use large input test data!

##14.2 Time Complexity
Time complexity expresses the relationship between the execution time of algorithm and input data. 

It is expressed in big-O notation. We will look into it in algorithm.
