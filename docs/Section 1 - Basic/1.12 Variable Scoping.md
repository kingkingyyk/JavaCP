#1.12 Variable Scoping

##1.12.1 Variable in Methods / Block
The way we did to declare variables is called as **local** variable declaration. Local variable is owned by method, so it will be destroyed when the method's execution is completed. If you need it to survive throughout the methods, you need to use **global** variable, or return it. 

The argument that is declared in the method is also local variable. It is created automatically when you invoke the method with external data. 

It is getting tricky in this part. 

This i is not that i :
```Java
public static void abc (int lol) {
	int i = 2; //We can still use i even though it has been defined in main method as that i in main method is bounded within that method.
	i+=2;
	System.out.println(i); //The i in this method refers to i above, so you should see 4.
	//Where is our i in the main method? The value is in lol!
}

public static void main (String [] args) {
	int i=0; //Local variable
	abc(i);
	System.out.println(i); //Prints 0.
}
```
Outside or inside?
```Java
public static void main (String [] args) {
	for (int i=0;i<10;i++) System.out.println(i);
	System.out.println(i); //Error, i belongs to for-loop block.

	int i2=0;
	for (;i2<10;i2++) System.out.println(i);
	System.out.println(i2); //OK, i2 belongs to method block, it can be used by any children block in the method block.
}
```

##1.12.2 Global Variable
The global variable in Java is still bound within the class, but it is available globally! The declaration is like this :
```Java
package HelloWorld;

public class HelloWorld {
	
	public static int number=3;

	public static void plus2() {
		HelloWorld.number+=2;
	}
	public static void main (String [] lol) {
		System.out.println(HelloWorld.number); //Prints 3
		plus2();
		System.out.println(HelloWorld.number); //Prints 5
	}
	
}
```

##1.12.3 Array
Array behaves identical to variable, but the reference for it is persistent. Object has the similar behaviour. 

With primitive type variable :
```Java
public static void updateValue (int number) {
	number+=100;
}

public static void main (String [] args) {
	int zzz=1;
	System.out.println(zzz); //Prints 2.
	updateValue(zzz);
	System.out.println(zzz); //Prints 2. The zzz+100 stays in the updateValue method.
}
```
With array/derived-type variable :
```Java
public static void updateArray (int [] ints) {
	int[1]=100;
}

public static void main (String [] args) {
	int [] lol={1,2,3,4};
	System.out.println(lol[1]); //Prints 2.
	updateArray(lol);
	System.out.println(lol[1]); //Prints 100. Persistent reference.
}
```
