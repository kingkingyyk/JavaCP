#1.07 Boolean & Conditions

##1.7.1 Boolean
Boolean only occupies 1 bit, 0 = false, 1 = true. It is used to represent the result of comparison, and various type of boolean operations. Since it is only single bit, the operation on it is extremely fast and memory saving. 

The available operators are : 

* ! [NOT]
* && [AND]
* || [OR]
* ^ [XOR]

Example: 
```Java
boolean b = false;
System.out.println( b ); // display false
b = !b; // b = NOT b
System.out.println( b ); // display true
```

##1.7.2 Comparison
There are some operators that can be used for comparison, and the result generated is a boolean :

* &gt; [More than]
* &gt;= [More than or Equal]
* == [Equal]
* != [Not equal]
* &lt;= [Less than or Equal]
* &lt; [Less than]

Example:

```Java
int i = 4;
boolean b = i > 5;
System.out.println( b ); // display false ( as i is less than 5 )
```

##1.7.3 Execution Flow Control
With the value of boolean (result from comparison), we can control the flow of code execution, i.e. which line of code should execute, which not to.

```Java
int i=123;
if ( i % 5 == 0 ) { // if i modulus 5 is 0
	System.out.println(i+" can be divided completely by 5!");
} else {
	System.out.println(i+" cannot be divided completely by 5!");
}
```
The output will display "123 cannot be divided completely by 5!". You can try to change the value of i to 125 can see what happens. 

You also can combine multiple conditions with the operators
```Java
int i=13;
if ( i%3==0 && i%5 == 0 ) { // if i modulus 3 and 5 is 0
	System.out.println(i+" can be divided by both 3 and 5!");
} else {
	System.out.println(i+" cannot be divided by both 3 and 5!");
}
```

Else if can be helpful when you need more condition checking... 
```Java
int i=13;
if ( i%3==0 && i%5 == 0 ) { // 1st condition : if i modulus 3 and 5 is 0
	System.out.println(i+" can be divided by both 3 and 5!");
} else if (i%3==0) {	// 2nd condition ( will be evaluated if 1st condition is false )
	System.out.println(i+" can only be divided by 3!");
} else if (i%5==0) {	// 3rd condition ( will be evaluated if 1st & 2nd conditions are false )
	System.out.println(i+" can only be divided by 3!");
} else {		// if conditions above are all false...
	System.out.println(i+" cannot be divided by both 3 and 5!");
}
Let's try with different values of i! 
```

In case you need to jump out from the loop halfway, you can use break keyword. The remaining part of code will be ignored and the code right below the loop will start execution. 

```Java
for (????) {
	if (????)
		break
}
```

##Exercise
By modifying the code from last section, add a message that tell the user whether he can go on the spaceship.

* If success, print “Welcome onboard!”
* If failed, print “Good luck while waiting for the next spaceship to come“.
