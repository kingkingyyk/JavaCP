#1.13 Library

##1.13.1 Introduction
Library is a collection of useful methods that helps you to code so that you don't need to reinvent the wheel again. To use a library, you must first import them. The built-in Java libraries are not imported by default. Previously, we have used the Scanner object to get the input from user, so we have to use the keyword
```Java
import java.util.Scanner;
```
above of the public class.

##1.13.2 File I/O
Here is the example on reading the content of a file and write them to a new file.
```Java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.BufferedWriter;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.PrintWriter;

public class HelloWorld {
	
    public static void main (String [] args) throws Exception {
        BufferedReader br=new BufferedReader(new FileReader("C:\\users\\kingkingyyk\\harlo_old.txt"));
        //create object to read the things in the file
        String line;
        String [] information=new String[100]; //i assume the file has 100 lines
        for (int i=0;(line=br.readLine())!=null;i++) { //read line by line until no more line
            information[i]=line; //save the text in the file into array
        }
        br.close(); //close the reading.
        PrintWriter pw=new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("C:\\users\\kingkingyyk\\harlo_new.txt")));
        for (int i=0;i<information.length;i++) {
            pw.println(information[i]); //write the data in the array to the file
        }
        pw.close(); //close the writing and write the data into the file.
    }
}
```
Remember to create a dummy file in any path you like for the program to read, then change the code accordingly to try it out!

##1.13.3 BigInteger & BigDecimal
If you want to deal with big or high precision number, these are the libraries you should use. The drawback is, the performance is way lower than primitive types. :)
```Java
import java.math.BigInteger;

public class HelloWorld {
	
public static void main (String [] args) {
		BigInteger bi1=new BigInteger("1231234243645789794123");
		BigInteger bi2=new BigInteger("723450468900890345890234");
		BigInteger bi3=bi1.multiply(bi2);
		System.out.println(bi3.toString());
	}
}
```

##1.13.4 Random
Random library produces random primitive type value. If you want to generate random data (test case?), you can use it.
```Java
import java.util.Random;
	
public class HelloWorld {
	
	public static void main (String [] args) {
		Random r=new Random(); //Create a randomizer object.
		for (int i=0;i<10;i++) { //Loop for 10 times
			System.out.println(r.nextInt(100)); //generate and display a random number
						      //from 0 to 99. (0 to 99 = 100 numbers)
		}
	}
}
```
nextDouble, nextBoolean, nextLong and more are available. Now, can you make a program that output random int that ranges from 100 to 200?
