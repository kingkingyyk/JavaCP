#3.3 From A to Z

##3.3.1 Introduction
Sorting is to let the data in the data set arranged in ascending or descending order.

To prevent confusion, the following explanations are for building ascending order sorting. Descending has the same algorithm, but in opposite way.

##3.3.2 Bubble Sort

* The simplest type of sorting, involves checking the adjacent slot. We go through from index 0 to n-1. If the value in i is more than the value in i+1, then we swap them. By looping the operation once, the largest value will be moved to the last index (n). 
* We can perform this operation for n times, then everything will be sorted.

* Original implementation
```Java
public static void bubblesort (int [] data) {
	for (int i=0;i<data.length;i++) {
		for (int i2=0;i2<data.length-1;i2++) {
			if (data[i2]>data[i2+1]) {
				//perform swapping.
				int temp=data[i2];
				data[i2]=data[i2+1];
				data[i2+1]=temp;
			}
		}
	}
}
```
* Optimized implementation : We know the largest value will go to the last index, therefore we can reduce the checking by 1 in every loop.
```Java
public static void bubblesort (int [] data) {
	for (int i=0;i<data.length-1;i++) {
		for (int i2=0;i2<data.length-1-i;i2++) {
			if (data[i2]>data[i2+1]) {
				//perform swapping.
				int temp=data[i2];
				data[i2]=data[i2+1];
				data[i2+1]=temp;
			}
		}
	}
}
```
* Time complexity is \(O(n^2)\). We swap the values until the largest is moved to the last index. This takes n operations. We also repeat such operations n times, therefore it is \((n)(n)=n^2\). The optimized version would run faster (up to 26% in 100,000 values)

##3.3.3 Selection Sort

* It runs like bubble sort as well, each loop will put the highest value into the last index.
* However it doesn’t perform as many comparison and swapping operations, which makes it faster than even the optimized version of bubble sort.
<div class="video-wrapper"><iframe width="960" height="540" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6nDMgr0-Yyo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
* The implementation is as follow :
```Java
public static void selectionsort (int [] data) {
	for (int i=0;i<data.length-1;i++) {
		int indexToFill=data.length-i-1;
		int indexWithHighestValue=indexToFill;
		for (int i2=0;i2<indexToFill;i2++) {
			//limit the search from unsorted range to reduce unnecessary checks.
			if (data[indexWithHighestValue]<data[i2]) {
				indexWithHighestValue=i2;
			}
		}
		if (indexWithHighestValue!=indexToFill) {
			//perform swapping
			int temp=data[indexToFill];
			data[indexToFill]=data[indexWithHighestValue];
			data[indexWithHighestValue]=temp;
		}
	}
}
```
* Time complexity is \(O(n^2)\), but the speed is up to 255% faster for 100,000 values compared to optimized bubble sort! This is due to much shorter time taken to perform a single n operation.

##3.3.4 Merge Sort
* A faster sort by using divide-and-conquer technique that involves splitting data set into smaller data sets and combine them back in order.
<div class="video-wrapper"><iframe width="960" height="540" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GCae1WNvnZM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
* It is recursive, so it would be much easier for us to implement it in recursion form.
```Java
private static void merge(int[] left, int[] right, int [] result) {
	int leftIndex = 0;
	int rightIndex = 0;
        int j = 0;
        while (leftIndex < left.length && rightIndex < right.length) {
        	// the compare values from both arrays.
        	// the smaller value go into the list first.
            if (left[leftIndex] < right[rightIndex]) {
                result[j] = left[leftIndex];
                leftIndex++;
            } else {
                result[j] = right[rightIndex];
                rightIndex++;
            }
            j++;
        }
        System.arraycopy(left, leftIndex, result, j, left.length - leftIndex);
        System.arraycopy(right, rightIndex, result, j, right.length - rightIndex);
	//copy back the result to the list.
}
    
public static void mergesort(int [] data) {
	if (data.length > 1) {
	        //split the data set into half.
	        int[] left = new int[data.length/2];
	        int[] right = new int[data.length-left.length];
	        System.arraycopy(data,0,left,0,left.length);
	        //copy first half values from original to left array.
	        System.arraycopy(data,left.length,right,0,right.length);
	        //copy second half values from original to right array.
	        mergesort(left);
	        mergesort(right);
	        merge(left,right,data);
	        //combine them.
        }
}

```
* The time complexity is \(O(n \,log_2⁡n)\)! The speed is way faster than \(O(n^2)\) sorting, up to 235 times faster than selection sort for 100,000 values sorting! Amazing!

##3.3.5 Quick Sort
* Yet another fast sorting algorithm.
* It works by picking a value (pivot), break the data set into half, and start sorting the data such that the left data is less than the pivot and the right data is more than the pivot.
* Such operation is continued by breaking the left part into 2 again and right part into 2 again.
<div class="video-wrapper"><iframe width="960" height="540" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y_G9BkAm6B8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
```Java
public static void quicksort(int[] data, int left, int right) {
	if (!(data==null || data.length==0 || left>=right)) {
		// pivot selection, in this case.. get the middle 1.
		int middle=left+(right - left)/ 2;
		int pivot=data[middle];

		int i=left;
		int i2=right;
		//left is less than pivot, right is more than pivot.
		while (i <= i2) {
			while (data[i] < pivot) i++;
			while (data[i2] > pivot) i2--;
			if (i <= i2) {
				//perform swapping.
				int temp=data[i];
				data[i]=data[i2];
				data[i2]=temp;
				i++;
				i2--;
			}
		}
		if (left < i2) quicksort(data, left, i2);
		if (right > i) quicksort(data, i, right);
	}
}

```
* The time complexity is \(O(n \,log_2⁡n)\) and the actual speed is similar to merge sort.
* The main difference between quick sort and merge sort is that quick sort is **unstable**, while merge sort is a **stable** sort. **Stable** is defined as if the data set happens to have 2 or more same values, the arrangement for that same values will remain intact. 

##Conclusion
Fortunately in Java, we don’t have to reinvent the wheel. We can use **Arrays.sort()**. It contains different types of sorting depending on the size of your data.
