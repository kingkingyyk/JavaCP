#3.5 Wrapping Up

* There are some rules of thumb
    * System calls are always faster. In the case you have seen
        * Copying arrays
        * Sorting & Searching
    * Unless notified, otherwise use as many as built-in API (methods) instead of writing yourself (reinventing the wheel)
    * If there is no time constraint, you should strive for the best algorithm when writing the code
* Exercise
    * Solves the questions in <a href="https://projecteuler.net/" target="_blank">Project Euler</a> until No. 36
    * Solves the questions in <a href="http://train.usaco.org/usacogate" target="_blank">USACO</a> section 1.5
* You should be pretty good now after solving the questions.
