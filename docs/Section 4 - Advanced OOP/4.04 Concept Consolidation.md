#4.4 Concept Consolidation

* When a child type has it’s method being called in parent form (i.e. we use School type variable to store the Kindergarten school), the method in the child will be called instead of the method in parent.
* Typecasting is allowed on the parent type to child type. If the object is not the type to be typecasted (i.e. cast Kindergarten school to Primary school), exception will be throw (check the console)
* If you want to call the same method of the parent in the child method, you can use super(<arguments>).
