#4.3 Abstract

Since we have the different types of school already, we might not want the user to create instance of “School”. We only allow them to create different types of school. In this case, `abstract` keyword can be used to prevent that.

Now, our School class would be like this
```Java
public abstract class School {
	private String name;
	private Student [] std;
	private int count;
	
	public School (String n) {
		this.name=n;
		this.std=new Student[100];
		this.count=0;
	}

	public String getName() {
		return this.name;
	}

	public void setName(String n) {
		this.name=n;
	}

	public void addStudent (Student s) {
		this.std[this.count++]=s;
	}
}
```
The method in the abstract class can be defined as abstract (hence no body is needed).
