#4.5 All are Welcome!

##4.5.1 Generic
In some cases, we might want to accommodate the class to some other different objects type. The concept of generic can be applied here.

Let’s create a class named as Bag that contains objects.
```Java
public class Bag<T> {
	private T [] obj;
	private int count;
	
	public Bag (int size) {
		this.obj=(T[]) new Object[size];
	}
	
	public void put (T t) {
		this.obj[this.count++]=t;
	}
	
	public void remove (T t) {
		for (int i=0;i<this.count;i++) {
			if (this.obj[i]==t) {
				this.obj[i]=this.obj[this.count-1];
				this.count--;
				break;
			}
		}
	}
}
```
<T> = generic. You can put more as the arugment, like <T, S> and <T1, T2> .

Then we modify our school class to use this generic class.
```Java
public abstract class School {
	private String name;
	private Bag<Student> std;
	
	public School (String n) {
		this.name=n;
		this.std=new Bag<>(100);
	}
	
	public String getName() {
		return this.name;
	}
	
	public void setName(String n) {
		this.name=n;
	}
	
	public void addStudent (Student s) {
		this.std.put(s);
	}
}
```
In other place, if you want to use such storage to store `int`, you can use `Bag<Integer>`. For storing `School`, you can use `Bag<School>`.

##4.5.2 Method Overloading
In Java, it is possible to define method with same name but with different arguments.
```Java
public static int sum (int a, int b) {
	return a+b;
}
	
public static int sum (int a, int b, int c) {
	return a+b+c;
}
```
However, the usage of it is limited and not vital for writing a program.
