#4.1 Constructor & Interface

##4.1.1 Constructor
In every class, you can define the construction method for initialization.
```Java
public class Student {
	public String name;
	public int mark;
	
	public Student (String n, int m) {
		this.name=n; //this = the newly created object.
		this.mark=m; //this = the newly created object.
	}
}
```

##4.1.2 Interface
Interface enforces the class to have certain method and we can use interface to refer to the object.

In this case, the compareTo() method in Comparable interface is used to determine the priority (value) of the object. The implementation is as follow :
```Java
public class Student implements Comparable<Student> {
	public String name;
	public int mark;
	
	public Student (String n, int m) {
		this.name=n; //this = the newly created object.
		this.mark=m; //this = the newly created object.
	}
	
	@Override
	public int compareTo (Student s) {
		return –(this.mark-s.mark); //comparing mark difference, - is added for descending order (-100 > -1)
	}
}

```
With this, we can use Arrays.sort(), and the method will use compareTo to determine the ordering internally.
