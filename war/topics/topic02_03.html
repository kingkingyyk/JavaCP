			3.1 The Execution Time
		</div>
		<div class="ContentText">
			It is important to know the time for the computer to execute your code. If you code is slow, it would exceed time limit (inefficient)! (Ever faced it in USACO?). 
			<br><br>
			It is also fun to compete this with others other than having correct answer. The simple way to measure execution time is to use timestamp.
			<pre><code class="Java">long timestampBefore = System.currentTimeMillis();
//run your code here.
long timestampAfter = System.currentTimeMillis();
long timeTaken = timestampAfter-timestampBefore;
System.out.println("Took "+timeTaken+"ms to run.");</code></pre>
			In order to measure the accurate value, use the same computer to run the codes. Run it for 5 times and get the median. Remember to use large input test data!

			3.2 Time Complexity
		</div>
		<div class="ContentText">
			Time complexity expresses the relationship between the execution time of algorithm and input data.
			<br><br>
			It is expressed in big-O notation. We will look into it in algorithm.
