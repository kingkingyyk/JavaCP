			3.1 Why Data Types
		</div>
		<div class="ContentText">
			In computer, everything is in binary form as the transistors only know off (0) and on(1). Single 0 or 1 in computer is called as a bit. We need a way to define how the data are represented in binary form, otherwise it is not possible for computer to process them.
			<br>
			In Java, we have many data types (or even define ourselves from base types), but those we use frequently are :
			<ul>
				<li>int - integer, natural number, that occupies 32 bits of memory, so it ranges from -2<sup>31</sup> to 2<sup>31</sup> - 1</li>
				<li>double - number with decimals, occupies 64 bits</li>
				<li>char - Single letter or sign, like 'a', ';', '1'</li>
			</ul>
			Now, let's try the following code:
			<pre><code class="Java">public static void main (String [] args) {
	System.out.println(1+1);
}</code></pre>
			Execute the program and see what happens to the console! Try to replace the 1 with different numbers and see the magic.

			3.2 Mathematical Operators
		</div>
		<div class="ContentText">
			There are some mathematical operators provided by Java natively:
			<ul>
				<li>+ -> Addition</li>
				<li>- -> Subtraction</li>
				<li>* -> Multiplication</li>
				<li>/ -> Division</li>
				<li>% -> Remainder</li>
				<li>Java is brilliant enough to know multiplication/division/remainder come first before addition/subtraction. If case of equal level of operations are on the same line, you need to put bracket to indicate the priority.
			</ul>
			<br>
			It is also possible to use + on String. Which the compiler does is, concate everything to a String. Refer to this :
			<pre><code class="Java">System.out.println(“One = ” + 1) );</code></pre>
			1 is an integer. In this situation, it will be converted into String and combined with "One = ".

		<div class="SubtitleText">
			3.3 Fusing Mathematical Operators with String
		</div>
		<div class="ContentText">
			It is important to know that, when dealing with String, the compiler will consider everything as String, if you don't put bracket explicitly. 
			<br><br>
			Case 1 :
			<pre><code class="Java">System.out.println(“ 1 + 1 = ” + 1 + 1 );</code></pre>
			will give 1 + 1 = 1 + 1.
			<br><br>
			Case 2 :
			<pre><code class="Java">System.out.println(“ 1 + 1 = ” + (1 + 1) );</code></pre>
			will give 1 + 1 = 2.

			Exercise
		</div>
		<div class="ContentText">
			Write the code that display the following in the console
			<ul>
				<li>123 + 567 = 690</li>
				<li>875 / 145 = 6.0344827586206895</li>
				<li>The remainder of 9 divided by 2 is 1.</li>
			</ul>
