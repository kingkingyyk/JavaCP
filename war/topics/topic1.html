			1.1 Generations of Language

			Programs are set of instructions to be executed by computer, which involves the operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and more. They are the fundamentals of a computer. Without a program, the computer doesn’t know what to do. A puppet doesn't move if you don't kick it. Programming is the activity of writing sequence of instructions that the computer understands.
			<br><br>
			Programming can be divided into few generations (just a rough idea, just for you to understand) :
			<ul>
				<li>Machine language - Basically composed by 0101010101011100101, only very experienced programmer and hardware designer could understand.</li>
				<li>Assembly language – Readable, but still requires the knowledge to know how the computer works, like allocating the main memory space for the data and pulling the data into register ( a high speed memory built inside the processor ).</li>
				<li>High level language – C, C++, Java, etc. Very readable. Provide high flexibility and yet low level functions, like accessing the memory address.</li>
				<li>Very high level language – SQL, etc. Can understand instructions by natural language-like syntax.</li>
				<li>Natural language / Visual language - NodeRed</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			Confused? It is fine for a programming newbie. You can ignore them above if you don't understand, as the reason of you being here is to code!
			<br><br>
			Since computer only understands machine language, it is important that we need a program, namely <b>complier</b> to translate the high level language into machine language for the computer to understand. It is something similar in real life. When you go to a country with citizens who don’t know your language, you need a translator to do the job for you. The fate treats us good where we don’t have to suffer with low level languages; The languages now are much more readable.
			<br><br>
			Java is a <b>cross platform</b> language, which means you can run the <b>same</b> code in different platforms. The Java complier only needs to convert the code into “bytecode” that can be understood by the virtual machine, then the program can runs on different operating systems. Voila! You don’t have to code for specific system; code once, runs everywhere.

			1.2 Java Compiler & IDE
		</div>
		<div class="ContentText">
			To start with the lesson, you need a complier. Java Development Kit is the complier.
			<ul>
				<li>Get your JDK <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html" target="_blank">here</a> and install it!
				</li>
			</ul>
			We also need an integrated development environment that provides us a nice 	user interface to code with. You have few options :
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://netbeans.org/downloads/index.html" target="_blank">NetBeans</a> (Not Recommended)</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Choose the one with Java SE!
				</ul>
				<li><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/eclipse-packages" target="_blank">Eclipse</a> (Portable, so extract and go!)</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Choose the one for Java Developers (64 bit)</li>
					<li>After downloading, unzip and run Eclipse.exe</li>
				</ul>
				<li><a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_java_online.php" target="_blank">Tutorialspoint</a></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Online Compiler</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			For simplicity, I'll use Eclipse as the IDE for this text.
