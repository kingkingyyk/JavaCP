			Now it is the time to unveil what really is the public static void main (String [] args) in a program. In Java, it is called as method, but in some other languages, it is called as function.
			<br><br>
			We have used System.out.println(), .length(), .split() and more. These are the methods provided by Java libraries natively. We can build our own method, too.
			<br><br>
			A frequent question that is asked by programming amateur : Why can’t I squeeze all instruction into a single method? Why would I want to separate my code into separate methods?
			<ul>
				<li>Reusability. Think of System.out.println, if we were to code it manually, wouldn’t it be very troublesome? The code that does the same thing will exist everywhere!</li>
				<li>Maintainability. If I change the code in a method, then the change will apply to all places, because all of them are referring to that method. Otherwise you have to change every copy of the code in your program.</li>
			</ul>
			Library is basically a collection of methods that aid us in doing something. String is a built-in library that gives us the implementation of char array. Scanner is the built-in library that gives us the functionality to get the input from console. There are way more useful libraries, and we shall talk about them later.
			<br><br>
			The method can be dissected as follow (Don't worry if you don't understand! We have an example to look at, later) :
			<pre><code class="Java">public static void main (String [] args) {
}</code></pre>
			<ul>
				<li>public -> The encapsulation scope of the method. We shall talk them in the section Object Oriented Programming section.</li>
				<li>static -> Owning of the method. Again, it will be covered in Object Oriented Programming section.</li>
				<li>void -> The return type of the method. You can return any type as you like.</li>
				<li>main -> The name for the method. The limitation is identical to variable naming.</li>
				<li>(String [] args) -> Defines the argument that the method requires.</li>
				<li>Lastly, don't forget the curly brackets! :)</li>
			</ul>
			*Drum rolls* Here comes the example : Write a function that checks whether the given number is a prime number or not.
			<ul>
				<li>First, identify what is the input and output of the method.					<ul>
						<li>The input is integer, in this case, as we need to have the number to check with.</li>
						<li>The output is boolean. We check whether it is a prime or not (true/false)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Second, write the method block. Leave our main method alone! You can write it on top our main method. So we have this now :
					<pre><code class="Java">public static boolean isPrime (int num) {
}

public static void main (String [] args) {
}</code></pre></li>
				<li>Write the logic in the method.
				<pre><code class="Java">public static boolean isPrime (int num) {
	double sqrt=Math.sqrt(num); //Get the square root of the number.
	if (num<=1) return false; //filter out the number lesser than 1.
	else {
		for (int i=2;i<=sqrt;i++) if (num%i==0) return false;
	}
	return true;
}</code></pre>
				<li>Now we can use our isPrime method in main method.
					<pre><code class="Java">public static void main (String [] args) {
	int [] ints={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10};
	for (int i=0;i&#60ints.length;i++) System.out.println(ints[i]+" is a prime number? "+isPrime(ints[i]))
}</code></pre>
				</li>
			</ul>
